# Furniture Science

A turn-based block-pushing puzzle game which is also a bit of a homage. Made in [Puzzle Script](https://www.puzzlescript.net) but actually the [Pancelor fork](https://pancelor.com/PuzzleScript/editor.html) because it has a level selector.

The game is currently in-development but the official play location will likely be in [vexorian.itch.io](https://vexorian.itch.io/).
